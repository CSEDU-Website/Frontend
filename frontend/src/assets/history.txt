The journey of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering started in a bright morning of September 1992. It was a brainchild of Dr. M. Lutfar Rahman, a visionary Professor of the Department of Applied Physics and Electronics, University of Dhaka, who felt the urge to come up with an academic department to tackle the snowballing necessity for computer scientists and IT specialists. In spite of a humble beginning, the department, then known as Department of Computer Science, attracted the very best minds of the nation and soon accumulated a star studded faculty roster as well as the brightest of the students.

The department started with a single classroom offering M.Sc. degree in Computer Science under the Faculty of Science. In 1994, three year B.Sc. Honors program was introduced which was upgraded to four year B.Sc. Honors program in 1997. It is the first department in the Faculty of Science to introduce the four year BSc. program in the University of Dhaka. In 2004, the name of the department was changed to Computer Science and Engineering, leading to its inclusion in the freshly formed Faculty of Engineering and Technology in 2008. In 2010, the four point grading system was introduced in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology.

Initially, the department started with 20 students in the M.Sc. program in 1992, and then started B.Sc. (Hons) program from 1995 with 21 students. With the increasing demand of Computer Science graduates for the nation, University of Dhaka increased the number of seats for B.Sc. (Hons) program to 60 in 1995. So far, 25 batches have completed their undergraduate studies and 5 batches are currently pursuing their degrees from the department. In addition, 31 batches have completed the graduate study (MSc/ MS) programs and currently 1 batch is continuing their MS coursework/ research. Although only 11 researchers completed PhD from this department, currently there are 4 PhD students pursuing towards their degrees in addition to 1 MPhil students.

In total, the department has 39 active teachers, 19 of whom have already earned their PhD degrees. Currently,14 faculty members are on leave for pursuing their PhDs from different universities of the world.

A summary of the faculty members are tinted in the following table:
